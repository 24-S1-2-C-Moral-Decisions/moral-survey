    <h3 class="font-semibold"> What is Reddit and its communities?</h3>
    <p class="pl-6">
        Reddit is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website. Registered users
        submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, and videos, which are then voted up or down by
        other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called "communities", each focusing
        on a specific topic or theme.
    </p>

    <h3 class="font-semibold mt-3">What is the r/AmItheAsshole community?</h3>
    <div class="pl-6">
        <p>
            r/AmItheAsshole, abbreviated as AITA, is a Reddit community where users post about their real-world
            interpersonal conflicts and receive judgment from other Reddit users.
        </p>
        <p>
            This community allows users to solicit and express opinions about whether the actions of people in
            specific scenarios are appropriate, especially the actions of Original Poster, the person reporting the
            situation.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="font-semibold mt-3">We categorize 2 Primary Judgments in the r/AmItheAsshole Community:</h3>
    <div class="pl-6">
        <h4 class="font-semibold mt-2">1. YA: Yes, the Individual reporting the situation is an Asshole.</h4>
        <div class="pl-6">
            <p>It combines two types of judgments from the AITA community:</p>
            <div class="pl-6">
                <p>You are The Asshole (YTA): the Individual reporting the situation is at fault.</p>
                <p>Everyone Sucks Here (ESH): all parties involved in the situation are at fault.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h4 class="font-semibold mt-2">2. NA: No, the Individual reporting the situation is Not an Asshole.</h4>
        <div class="pl-6">
            <p>It combines two types of judgments from the AITA community:</p>
            <div class="pl-6">
                <p>You are Not The Asshole (NTA): the Individual reporting the situation is not at fault in the
                    situation.</p>
                <p>No Asshole Here (NAH): none of the parties involved are at fault.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Your task in part 1:</h2>
<p>Below are 2 examples to test your understanding of controversy and uncertainty in a moral situation with chart
    and text information provided. It is important to correctly understand concepts of controversy and uncertainty.
</p>

<div class="my-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">1.1 What is Controversy? </h3>
    <p>Controversy reflects how split people's judgements are in a situation:</p>

    <div class="my-3 pl-6">
        <p>High controversy means people's opinions are split almost evenly among 2 judgments (YA, NA).</p>
        <p>Low controversy means a clear consensus among the whole population, or say people's opinions leaning to
            one of the judgments.</p>

        <div>
            <p>For every 100 Reddit users who made judgements:</p>
            <div class="my-3 pl-6">
                <p>98 users believe NA - the individual reporting the situation is Not the Asshole; Of the 98 users,
                    66% are very certain and 34% are not very certain.</p>
                <p>2 users believe YA - the individual reporting the situation is The Asshole; Of the 2 users, 100%
                    are very certain and 0% are not very certain.</p>

            <p>Explanation: The situation a low controversy because 98% of the whole population choose NA judgement,
                which means their consensus over NA, instead of their being split into 2 judgements.</p>
            <p>Note: To proceed, you need to choose the correct answer in both practice questions, including 1.1 and
                1.2.</p>

            group:</p>
        <div class="pl-6 my-3">
            <p>High uncertainty means over half of people in a judgement group are not very certain in their judgment;
